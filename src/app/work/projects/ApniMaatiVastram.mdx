## Overview

During my internship at **Apni Maati Vastram**, I focused on building and optimizing the companyâ€™s e-commerce platform while spearheading targeted social media campaigns. These initiatives directly contributed to improving the company's online presence and sales performance.

## Key Contributions

- **E-commerce Website Development**: Designed, built, and maintained an intuitive e-commerce website to improve user experience, resulting in a **35% increase in online sales**.
- **Social Media Marketing**: Developed and executed targeted marketing campaigns on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, leading to a **20% boost in customer engagement and brand visibility**.
- **Analytics and Optimization**: Used tools like Google Analytics and Meta Ads Manager to track user behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the website was both scalable and user-friendly. Balancing creative design with performance metrics taught me the importance of an iterative approach to development and marketing. Moreover, analyzing campaign performance metrics provided hands-on experience with data-driven decision-making.

## Outcome

The combination of an improved website and strategic marketing campaigns significantly increased sales and brand reach. The internship provided a comprehensive experience in blending technical skills with creative problem-solving to achieve measurable business outcomes.
